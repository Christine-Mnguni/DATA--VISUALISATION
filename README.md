# 📊 Inc. 5000 Data Visualization Project (2014)

This Tableau project explores the 2014 Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The goal was to analyze trends in industry growth, company longevity, employee size, and geographic distribution.

## ✅ Questions Explored

1. **Which industries saw the most growth?**
   - Created bar charts and treemaps to show top-performing industries by average growth.
   
2. **Do companies that have been on the list longer have a higher chance of appearing again?**
   - Used scatter plots to compare longevity (years on the list) with appearance frequency.
   
3. **Does the number of workers affect a company’s growth?**
   - Created a bubble chart to visualize employee count vs. growth percentage.
   
4. **Which state has the highest number of IT companies?**
   - Mapped IT companies geographically using Tableau maps to identify state distribution.
   
5. **Which cities have seen the most growth?**
